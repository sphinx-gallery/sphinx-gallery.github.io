  https://jupyterlite.readthedocs.io/en/latest/howto/index.html#configuring-the-python-environment
[cli]: https://jupyterlite.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/cli.html

## Uninstall

To remove the extension, run:

```bash
pip uninstall jupyterlite-pyodide-kernel
```

## Development Install

Below is an short overview of getting up and running quickly. Please see the
[contributing guide][contrib] for full details.

### Development Requirements

**Recommended** a Python virtual environment provided by a tool of choice, e.g.

- `virtualenv`
- `mamba`
- `conda`

Ensure the local development environment has:

- `git`
- `nodejs 18`
- `python >=3.8`

### Development Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jupyterlite/pyodide-kernel
cd pyodide-kernel
npm run quickstart
```

Then, serve the built demo site, documentation, and test reports with Python's built-in
http server:

```bash
jlpm serve
```
