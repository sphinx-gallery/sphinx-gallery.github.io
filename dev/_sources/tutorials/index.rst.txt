Notebook-style Narrative Gallery
================================

You can have multiple galleries, each one for different uses. For example,
one gallery of examples and a different gallery for tutorials.

This gallery demonstrates the ability of Sphinx-Gallery to transform a file
with a Jupyter notebook style structure (i.e., with alternating text and code).

For this to be used you need to respect some syntax rules. This example demonstrates how to alternate text and code blocks and some edge cases. It was designed to be compared with the source Python script &lt;plot_parse.py&gt;.">
